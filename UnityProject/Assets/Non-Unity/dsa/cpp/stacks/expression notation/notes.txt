Notations to write expressions 
1.Infix
2.Prefix
3.Postfix


I) INFIX = what we use everyday
<operand><opereator><operand>
has operator precedence, has some ambiguity tied to it, but all in all, it works


II) PREFIX (polish notation aka)
<operator><operand><operand>

Infix  2+3 => Prefix + 2 3
Infix a + b*c => Prefix + a * bc

III) POSTFIX (reverse polish)

<operand> <operand> <operator>
Infix -> a + b * c
in Postfix -> a b c * +

overall, infix is human readable 
but postfix and prefix is good for the machine
postfix being the best 
no need for braces or operator precedence for prefix and postfix

EVALUATION OF PREFIX 
AND POSTFIX EXPRESSIONS

done in evaluate postfix (using stack)

and for prefix, just do the same but evaluate expression from last to first


CONVERSION FROM INFIX TO POSTFIX
There is an algorithm for this which converts 
by just parsing through expression once
