What is Stack ADT?
A Stack is a list with the restriction that 
insertion and deletion can be performed from 
one end only

Operations:
1. Push(x) //Add topmost
2. Pop() // Remove topmost
3. Top() // Get the topmost element
4. IsEmpty()

^^ All 4 above operations have complexity O(1)


Stacks are LIFO
L-Last
I-In
F-First
O-Out
The element insert last is the one thats outted the First


Common Applications of Stack:-
-> Function Calls/Recursion (Stack memory)
-> Undo operation
-> Balanced paranthesis


Can implement Stacks using 
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
