G R A P H S

the points in the graphs are called nodes/vertices
the lines connecting the points are called edges

N nodes in graph => N-1 edges

Tree vs graph => There are NO rules on connections b/w nodes
A tree is a type of graph

Mathematically, graph data structure G is an ordered pair
of a set V of vertices and set E of edges

G = (E, V)

now vertices can be named as v1, v2, v3 etc etc

Next are the edges. How do you represent edges? with the
two vertices that the edge connects. Now edges can be of 
two types. Directed and non-Directed edges. directed are 
unidirectional links and non-directed are bi-directional.

directional: a --> b
non-directional: a <--> b

in directed example, a is "origin", b is "destination"
if another link b --> a was created, it would be Mathematically
represented as (b, a), and the original a-->b link is 
Mathematically represented as (a, b). Which are ordered pairs.
where order matters.
For non-directional edges, their Mathematical representation 
is {a, b} which is an unordered pair.

Therefore graph in math would be something like
V = {v1, v2, v3, v4}
E = { {v1, v2}, {v2, v3}, {v3, v4},
     {v1, v4}, {v1, v3}, {v2, v4} }


Graph with all directed edges = "Directed Graph" or "Digraph"
(arrow marks for direction)

Graph with all undirected edges = "undirected graph"    
(no arrow marks)

A social network is an example for a digraph
Webpages on a site are an example for a directed graph
